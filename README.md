 Hades' Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! I'm Hades, a mechatronics engineering student with a passion for robotics and software. This repository highlights my completed and ongoing projects.

## Completed Projects

- **Face Recognition** - A face recognition module for the DaVinci smart locker project. Built using Python, OpenCV, and the face-recognition library, it loads and matches facial encodings to enable secure access. Key functionalities:
  - Load facial encodings from images
  - Generate new encodings for new users
  - Compare live camera input to stored encodings to verify identity

## Ongoing Projects

- **Metis** - An assistant platform combining a Discord bot with a Flask web dashboard. It uses asynchronous concurrency to manage bot interactions while serving a web interface. The goal is to integrate GPT-based features for advanced conversation and to connect with other services. I'm currently refining the architecture and adding new modules.

- **DungeonBuddy** - A digital companion for Dungeons & Dragons. This project will help manage character sheets, automate dice rolls, and provide quick rule look-ups. Work is in the early planning stage; check back soon for updates!
